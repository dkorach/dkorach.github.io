What is a website? We all use numerous versions of them each day, yet there are very few of us who actually understand what each site is, how its made, and how it works. Also, what the difference is between commonly thrown around terms such as webpage, search engine, or web server compared to a website. To begin, a webpage, what you see as soon as you enter your browser, is a document which can be displayed in a browser of your choice.  A webpage is written in HTML or hypertext markup language that along with other codes allows for stylistic and immersive designs among other improvements. This leads directly into the idea of a website. A website is a collection of linked web pages (in addition to what they have on or in them) that share a unique domain name (the part that goes in the address bar). Websites often posses links to other sites within their own in the form of hypertext or website links embedded within text or other objects. Now, a web server is an often large computer hosting one or multiple websites that upon user request gives their computer access to websites that it hosts. Finally we have search engines. Search engines are websites themselves that allow users to search for websites on the internet, in some cases giving users billions of relevant search results that are found using algorithms to determine relevance. Next, there are different types of websites in static sites and dynamic websites. The main difference between them is that dynamic is always moving. Each time a user visits a dynamic site it is built just prior to their arrival meaning that it is tailored to that user specifically based upon updates or previously selected preferences or aspects chosen by the user. This in contrast to static which produces the previously constructed website displayed identically to every user. Websites are the clear staple of the internet and now understanding how they work, and what makes them work can allow you to appreciate the wonders of the internet with greater intelligence.
