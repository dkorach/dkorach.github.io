--- The two different main types of mindset that we encounter in just about ever facet of our lives are fixed mindset and growth mindset. A fixed mindset is a way of thinking that basically states you posses a fixed amount of traits and that your goal is to utilizes what you have to appear to be smart. This sounds acceptable as a general mindset, however their is no internal realization of expansion or improvement. The main goal of this mindset is to allocate the predetermined quantity of resources in a way that allows you to display your intelligence, but without the possibility for growth. On the converse, a growth mindset is based around the idea of expansion and overall growth. More specifically, this growth occurs through improving upon the limited resources you are given through effort and persistence. The growth mindset is more than applicable to the life of a programmer as it promotes constant editing, fixing, and improvement. Programmers always, regardless of what they are doing, encounter issues with their work that can only be remedied through constant persistence and dedication to your work. Like the growth mindset that prides itself on improvement and constant expansion of your abilities, programming requires lots of self-instruction and self-reflection in order to improve both yourself and your work. A quote that adequately reflects upon the principles of the growth mindset reads: “Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed no hope at all.” This quote from Dale Carnegie is a perfect way to reflect upon the ideals of the growth mindset and describe that many of the worlds great achievements spawn from the desire to improve and the persistence of their creators. The differences between the growth and fixed mindsets are clear and their characteristics clearly indicate the relevance of the growth mindset to the life and work of a programmer.
