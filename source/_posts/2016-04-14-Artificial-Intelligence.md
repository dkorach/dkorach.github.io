Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently a main area of research and study for computer scientists and engineers around the world. AI is a field in which us humans have only scratched the surface with in our pursuit to create essentially a computerized human being. AI in a literal sense is the intelligence exhibited by machines or software but also is the namesake for the area of study of creating computers and software capable of intelligent, or human-like behavior. The man who coined the term AI in 1955 created a full fledged definition of the term saying AI is: “The science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” Since Mr. McCarthy created the ideological framework for the creation of an Artificial, computerized being people have been fascinated with the idea of it ever since. 

Mainstream society is only introduced to AI when they interact with a basic robot or here about the development of a new robot on the news. This predicament leads me to the basic question of: How does AI actually work? One of the hardest human characteristics to replicate is the power and ability of the human brain. However, since the invention of some of the main principles of AI, scientists have been studying ways where they can essentially digitize the neural communication of he brain and integrate that into a computer. One of the more modern concepts is the recurrent neural network which allows cyclical communication between to areas of a computer by transmitting a signal through the device to direct it to do some kind of action encoded within its data centers and as directed by the user. Other human-like aspects of AI are its ability to search and use logic to solve problems. For logic, different algorithms such as satplan are used for planning and inductive logic programming is a method for learning, allowing AI beings to gain knowledge. They also use complex algorithms that allow them to search through their memory as well as the internet for information as requested by the user. Overall, AI’s potential far outweighs our knowledge of it and will play a pivotal role in the future of human beings and computer science.
